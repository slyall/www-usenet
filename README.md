Usenet.net.nz Website
=====================

[Hugo](http://gohugo.io) based version of his website. I created it mainly to get the hang of Hugo.

The site is static and just consists of a single page. This is actually
a little hard to do since Hugo is orientated around the front page being
made up of lists of articles and similar. There are some ideas in the 
Hugo road-map to make this easier in the future (this was originally using Hugo 0.15)
