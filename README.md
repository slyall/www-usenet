Usenet.net.nz Website
=====================

[Hugo](http://gohugo.io) based version of his website. I created it mainly to get the hang of Hugo.

Hugo is a static site generator. You create markdown files with the content, some config files, other files with CSS and images and then run Hugo against them (on my server). Hugo then creates the HTML files which just need to be copied to the web server. No database or code (php, python, etc) needs to be running on the server so it can serve the files very quickly and you don't have to work about getting hacked or bugs in your code.

The site is static and just consists of a single page. This is actually
a little hard to do since Hugo is orientated around the front page being
made up of lists of articles and similar. There are some ideas in the 
Hugo road-map to make this easier in the future (this was originally using Hugo 0.15)
